HOWTO INSTALL

1) make sure you have /bin/bash reachable!
   Yes - this is linuxism and bashism - it's currently the way I put this together

2) check this out to /usr/local/bashlib

3) ln -s ../bashlib/lib /usr/local/lib/bashlib
   This is to encapsulate the git repo from the locations to use in the system

4) Optionally configure /etc/bashlibrc
